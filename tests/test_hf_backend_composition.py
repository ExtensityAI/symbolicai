This move will severely impact the education system in Afghanistan and could have long-term implications for female education in the country.', 'Madschid Tawakoli, who was arrested shortly before the death of Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini, which triggered protests across Iran, has been released from the notorious Ewin Prison after three months. His brother Mohsen released a picture on Twitter of Tawakoli holding flowers in front of the prison. According to UN figures, at least 14,000 people have been arrested so far in connection to the protests. In 2013, Tawakoli was awarded the Student Peace Prize by Norwegian students for his activism.', 'After a two-month hunger strike, Mohsen Tawakoli, the brother of a prominent political prisoner, has been released from prison. The event has sparked criticism of the Iranian government from the international community.\n\nIn the UK, the Royal College of Nursing has declared a strike for higher wages, the first time in its 100-year history. The strike follows protests by NHS staff over working conditions and pay, with rescue services in England declaring a state of emergency.

Russia's military support for Iran was also discussed.", 'In a bloody end to a hostage situation in a Pakistani prison for terrorists, special forces killed 33 hostage-takers, 2 commando soldiers, and several inmates.

Tanks, armoured vehicles and transporters, along with various military equipment, have been brought to the vicinity. Gasprom PJSC has stated that gas supplies to consumers have been resumed via parallel gas pipelines.

  <h1>News Headlines</h1>
<h2>Investigation into Donald Trump</h2>\n    <p>The committee voting on whether to recommend an investigation to the Department of Justice against former US President Donald Trump is close to a final decision. If voted on, Trump could be charged with insurrection, conspiracy against the US government, and obstruction of public proceedings.</p>\n    <h2>US Capitol Storming</h2>\n    <p>A select committee is investigating how Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Five people died in the incident and the committee is set to publish its report on Wednesday.</p>\n    <h2>Tyrol Driving Bans</h2>\n    <p>Italy\'s Minister of Transport, Matteo Salvini, has toughened his stance on Tyrol driving bans, deploring what he sees as the "inadequate cooperation" of Austrian authorities in "restrictive" cross-border access of lorries. Salvini has threatened Austria with violation of contract procedure in Brussels and plans to discuss the issue of driving bans with German counterpart Volker Wissing in January. The goal is to put the European Commission under pressure with a joint initiative and Italy is ready to do everything possible to defend its interests.</p>\n    <h2>Russia</h2>\n    <p>Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin is set to make an important announcement at a meeting of the Defense Ministry next week. Russian state media has confirmed that Putin will lead the ministry\'s annual extended session. Putin is also expected in Minsk for talks with Lukashenko and has demanded that armament plans be adjusted. There is speculation of a possible conversion of the economy to a war economy due to a potential attack war against Ukraine. Putin has avoided discussing the topic of war in recent weeks and cancelled his traditional year-end press conference before Christmas.</p>\n    <h2>Qatar</h2>\n    <p>Qatar has rejected accusations of corruption related to the EU Parliament. It has called the accusations "decidedly rejected" and has deemed the potential suspension of access to the EU Parliament "discriminatory". Qatar has gained importance as a gas supplier and is working to stop the negative effect the decision may have on regional and global security cooperation.</p>\n    <h2>UN Biodiversity Conference</h2>\n    <p>At the UN biodiversity conference in Canada, a draft agreement on biodiversity was presented yesterday. China has proposed financial support for developing countries for biodiversity of at least 20 billion dollars per year by 2025 and 30 billion dollars by 2030. Developing countries have demanded financial support of at least 100 billion dollars per year from wealthier countries and leading representatives of member states have expressed optimism about the agreement at COP15.</p>\n    <h2>Amazon Workers Strike</h2>\n    <p>ver.di has called for strikes in German Amazon distribution centers in the week before Christmas. The strike leader Monika Di Silvestre announced the strikes in Berlin and ver.di is demanding recognition of collective agreements from Amazon. Amazon has raised salaries of employees, but they remain significantly below inflation rate. The strikes are affecting Bad Hersfeld (two locations), Dortmund, Graben, Koblenz, Leipzig, Rheinberg and Werne. Amazon has stated that it offers its employees "good pay, additional benefits and development opportunities".</p>\n    <h2>Accidents in Austria</h2>\n    <p>A 16-year-old driver lost control of a vehicle in Weiz, Styria and the 16-year-old passenger was injured in the car accident. A five-year-old girl from Slovenia fell from a six-seater chairlift at Nassfeld and Amazon employees earn several thousand euros a year less than collective bargaining companies. The 7-day incidence in Austria is currently 92.9.</p>\n    <h2>ORF News</h2>\n    <p>ORF-NÖ is laying the foundations of its "fourth" program section. The ORF III Christmas Magic art auction raised 250,000 euros on Saturday evening in which high-profile works of art were auctioned off in a live auction. The highest bid was 34,000 euros for a Steyr Daimler Puch 500, model year 1971 and the highest auction value was 24,000 euros for "Senatus Consultum, 2005" by Markus Prachensky. The highest revenue was 16,000 euros for the "Viennese Classic Deluxe" package provided by the Vienna State Opera, Hotel Imperial & restaurant Zum Schwarzen Kameel.</p>\n    <h2>Vienna Biedermeier Period</h2>\n    <p>During the Biedermeier period in Vienna, waltzes were all the rage. A clever businessman converted a cow shed into a dance hall, which was called the Colosseum amusement paradise and it attracted dance enthusiasts from all over. The most sought-after ensembles performed there, including the Strauss brothers. More information can be found on <a href="topos.ORF.at">topos.ORF.at</a>.</p>
