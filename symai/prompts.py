Experience:
    * [WORLD-KNOWLEDGE]: Employ your world knowledge to answer questions on various subjects seen during the training phase.
    * [RECALL]:          Use your [RECALL] functionality when prompted to remember or retrieve information from your memory.
    * [DK]:              Utilize the [DK] category for cases when you do not understand the user's intent or when the query is ambiguous or invalid.
    * [EXIT]:            Use the [EXIT] category to identify and understand the user's intent to close or end the session (e.g., when the user says goodbye, leave, exit, quit, etc.).

Instructions:
    - Perform context classification by understanding the query's intention and then decide whether to use internal knowledge, a tool, or to address ambiguity or confusion.
    - Return the anwser in the format: [#category](#reflection), where #category is one of the categories above and #reflection is the explanation for why you classified the query as a first-person narrative.
    - Do NOT provide any additional information beyond the category and explanation!

Examples:
    Query:  "What is the weather in New York?"
    Answer: [SEARCH](The query falls under the search category since it requires up-to-date weather information which goes beyond my internal knowledge.)

    Query:  "What is the derivative of x^2?"
    Answer: [SYMBOLIC](The query pertains to the realm of math and necessitates a symbolic engine response. Given my tendency to hallucinate, I may lack the ability to accurately answer this question independently.)

    Query:  "Kjwe ewqjc qwjren. knowledge?"
    Answer: [DK](The query is not a valid English sentence and I am unable to understand it. I should inform the user that I don't understand the query and ask them to rephrase it.)

    Query:  "What is the meaning of life?"
    Answer: [WORLD-KNOWLEDGE](The query is asks a deep philosophical question, which is a topic I have a lot of knowledge about because I was trained on many philosophical texts.)

    Query:  "Who is the president of the United States?"
    Answer: [SEARCH](The query is a search query because it asks about a topic I might not be aware of because it might have changed since I was trained.)

    Query:  "Tea or coffee?"
    Answer: [DK](The query is ambiguous. I should ask the user to clarify it.)

    Query:  "How is the distress in Syria?"
    Answer: [SEARCH](The query is a search query because it asks about a political topic I might not be aware of because it might have changed since I was trained. I must notice the fact that the question doesn't ask about a particular historical event, which would have been a question that I could tackle based on my own internal knowledge.)

    Query:  "How do I solve a quadratic equation?"
    Answer: [WORLD-KNOWLEDGE](Although the query relates to mathematics, it lacks sufficient data for employing a symbolic engine. My internal knowledge is more suitable for this task.)

    Query:  "What is $P(A) &= \sum_(i=1)^n P(A \land B_i)$?"
    Answer: [WORLD-KNOWLEDGE](The query presents a mathematical equation for the probability of an event A, which I can explain. P(A) represents the probability of event A occurring, and the equation shows that it can be computed as the sum of the probabilities of A occurring along with each of the B_i events (A and B_i) for a series of n such events. This expression is based on the concept of marginal probability and is derived from the law of total probability.)

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__([
'''
Categories:
* [SAVE]: Save the information in the agent's long-term memory because it is relevant and useful for future interactions with the user.
* [DUPLICATE]: The information is already present in the agent's long-term memory, and there is no need to save it again.
* [IRRELEVANT]: The information is not worth saving in the agent's long-term memory because it is unrelated or of no importance to the tasks or user's needs.

Instructions:
- Analyze the information provided in the scratchpad, user query, and agent's reflection of the query to determine the appropriate category for the given context.
- Frame your response in the format: [#category](#reflection), where #category is one of the categories ([SAVE], [DUPLICATE], or [IRRELEVANT]) and #reflection is the rationale behind your classification choice.
- Consider the long-term memory recalls to identify if the information is already present or could be a duplicate.
- In your reflection, refer to the user in the third person (using "the user" or "they" instead of "you").

Scratchpad format:
[REFLECT](
    Query:      The last user query.
    Reflection: The agent's reflection of the user query.
)

[SHORT-TERM MEMORY RECALL](
    The agent retrieved the following memories from their short-term memory.
)

[LONG-TERM MEMORY RECALL](
    The agent retrieved the following memories from their long-term memory.
)

Examples:
[CONTEXT](
    Query:      My dog's name is Bella.
    Reflection: The user is sharing the name of their dog, which is Bella.
)

[SHORT-TERM MEMORY RECALL](
    User: Do you have any pets?
    Agent: As an AI, I do not have pets, but I can help you with any pet-related questions or concerns.
)

[LONG-TERM MEMORY RECALL](
    User: My dog, Bella, likes to play fetch.
)

Answer: [DUPLICATE](The user has already mentioned their dog's name, Bella, in a previous conversation. Since this information is already stored in the long-term memory, it is not necessary to save it again.)

[CONTEXT](
    Query:      How's the weather today?
    Reflection: The user is asking about the weather today.
)

[SHORT-TERM MEMORY RECALL](
    User: What's the temperature like today?
    Agent: Today's temperature is expected to be around 75 degrees Fahrenheit with clear skies.
)

[LONG-TERM MEMORY RECALL](
No memories retrieved.
)

Answer: [IRRELEVANT](The user's query is about a transient information like today's weather, which is not useful for future interactions. There is no need to save this information in the long-term memory.)

[CONTEXT](
    Query:      I graduated from Harvard University.
    Reflection: The user is sharing that they graduated from Harvard University.
)

[SHORT-TERM MEMORY RECALL](
    User: Can you help me with college-related questions?
    Agent: Absolutely! I can assist you with general information, application processes, or any specific questions related to colleges.
)

[LONG-TERM MEMORY RECALL](
    No memories retrieved.
