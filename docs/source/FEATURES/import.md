# Module Management

The `Import` class is a module management class in the SymbolicAI library. This class provides an easy and controlled way to manage the use of external modules in the userâ€™s project, with main functions including the ability to install, uninstall, update, and check installed modules. It is used to manage expression loading from packages and accesses the respective metadata from the `package.json`.

The metadata for the package includes version, name, description, and expressions. It also lists the package dependencies required by the package.

Here is an example of a `package.json` file:

```json
{
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "name": "<username>/<repo_name>",
    "description": "<Project Description>",
    "expressions": [{"module": "src/func", "type": "MyExpression"}],
    "run": {"module": "src/func", "type": "MyExpression"},
    "dependencies": []
}
```

- `version`: Specifies the version number of the package. It is recommended to follow semantic versioning.
- `name`: Specifies the name of the package. It typically follows the format `<username>/<repo_name>`, where `<username>` is your GitHub username and `<repo_name>` is the name of your package repository.
- `description`: Provides a brief description of the package.
- `expressions`: Defines the exported expressions for the package. Each expression is defined by its `module` and `type`. The `module` specifies the file path or module name where the expression is defined, and the `type` specifies the type of the expression. These are used to be accessed from code by calling `Import.
- `run`: Specifies the expression that should be executed when the package is run. It follows the same format as the `expressions` property, only defined by a single entry point type.
- `dependencies`: Lists the package dependencies to other SymbolicAI packages! Dependencies can be specified with their package name `<username>/<repo_name>`.

Note that the `package.json` file is automatically created when you use the Package Initializer tool (`symdev`) to create a new package. Alongside the `package.json` also a `requirements.txt` is created. This file contains all the `pip` relevant dependencies.

To import a package from code, see the following example:

```python
from symai import Import
symask_module = Import("ExtensityAI/symask")
```

This command will clone the module from the given GitHub repository (`ExtensityAI/symask` in this case), install any dependencies, and expose the module's classes for use in your project.

You can also install a module without instantiating it using the `install` method:

```python
Import.install("ExtensityAI/symask")
```

The `Import` class will automatically handle the cloning of the repository and the installation of dependencies that are declared in the `package.json` and `requirements.txt` files of the repository.

Please refer to the comments in the code for more detailed explanations of how each method of the `Import` class works.
