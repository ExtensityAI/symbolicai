Engines
================================================================

Due to limited computing resources, we currently utilize OpenAI's GPT-3, ChatGPT and GPT-4 API for the neuro-symbolic engine. However, given adequate computing resources, it is feasible to use local machines to reduce latency and costs, with alternative engines like OPT or Bloom. This would enable recursive executions, loops, and more complex expressions.

Furthermore, we interpret all objects as symbols with different encodings and have integrated a set of useful engines that convert these objects into the natural language domain to perform our operations.
