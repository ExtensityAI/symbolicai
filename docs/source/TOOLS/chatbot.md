## ⚠️  Outdated or Deprecated Documentation ⚠️
This documentation is outdated and may not reflect the current state of the SymbolicAI library. This page might be revived or deleted entirely as we continue our development. We recommend using more modern tools that infer the documentation from the code itself, such as [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/ExtensityAI/symbolicai). This will ensure you have the most accurate and up-to-date information and give you a better picture of the current state of the library.

You can engage in a basic conversation with `Symbia`, a chatbot that uses `SymbolicAI` to detect the content of your request and switch between different contextual modes to answer your questions. These modes include search engines, speech engines, and more. To start the chatbot, simply run:

```bash
$> symchat
```

This will launch a chatbot interface:

```bash
Symbia: Hi there! I'm Symbia, your virtual assistant. How may I help you?
$>
```

To exit the conversation, type `exit`, `quit`, or press `Ctrl+C`.
You can also load our chatbot `SymbiaChat` into a jupyter notebook and process step-wise requests.
