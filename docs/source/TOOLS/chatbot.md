# Chatbot

You can engage in a basic conversation with `Symbia`, a chatbot that uses `SymbolicAI` to detect the content of your request and switch between different contextual modes to answer your questions. These modes include search engines, speech engines, and more. To start the chatbot, simply run:

```bash
$> symchat
```

This will launch a chatbot interface:

```bash
Symbia: Hi there! I'm Symbia, your virtual assistant. How may I help you?
$>
```

To exit the conversation, type `exit`, `quit`, or press `Ctrl+C`.
You can also load our chatbot `SymbiaChat` into a jupyter notebook and process step-wise requests.
