      <p class="font-weight-bold text-primary">Cybersecurity Consolidation and the Equifax Settlement</p>
      <p>The upcoming year is likely to see a wave of cybersecurity consolidation, according to Jay Chaudhry, the CEO of Zscaler. This could be a major boon for stocks with high profit margins, which may rally by more than 50%. Consumers may also benefit from the Equifax settlement, receiving payments to help protect their online identities.</p>
      <p>However, it is important to understand the risks associated with using password managers to protect your online identity. Password managers can be a useful tool, but they can also create a single point of failure, meaning if someone were to gain access to your password manager, they would have access to all of your passwords. Therefore, it is important to do your research before deciding to use one.</p>
